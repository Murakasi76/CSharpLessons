🧠 CSharpLessons

This solution contains a collection of focused C# projects, each dedicated to a specific learning topic. Every project is self-contained and designed to reinforce core programming concepts, best practices, and real-world patterns.

📁 Project List

\- LessonArray — Working with arrays, user input, and memory allocation



📘 LessonArray

Topic: Array fundamentals and dynamic resizing

This project demonstrates basic array operations in C#:

\- Prompts the user to enter the desired array length

\- Fills the array using a custom formula: (i + i) \* i / 3

\- Creates a new array with 5 additional slots

\- Copies the original array into the new one

\- Prints all elements of the new array to the console

🔍 Key Concepts

\- Console.ReadLine input parsing with validation

\- Array initialization and indexing

\- CopyTo method for array duplication

\- foreach loop for output

▶️ How to Run

\- Open the solution CSharpLessons in Visual Studio

\- Set LessonArray as the startup project

\- Run the application (Ctrl + F5)

\- Enter a number when prompted (e.g., 10)

\- View the generated array output in the console



📘 HW1 — Jagged Array Text Parser

Topic: Jagged arrays and string manipulation

This project demonstrates how to process a block of text and store its structure using jagged arrays:

\- A hardcoded paragraph is split into sentences

\- Each sentence is further split into words

\- The result is stored in a jagged array: string\[]\[]

\- All words from the last sentence are printed to the console

🔍 Key Concepts

\- string.Split() for sentence and word segmentation

\- Jagged array declaration and initialization

\- Iteration with foreach and indexing

\- Basic text normalization and trimming

▶️ How to Run

\- Open the solution CSharpLessons in Visual Studio

\- Set HW1 as the startup project

\- Run the application (Ctrl + F5)

\- Observe the sentence breakdown and word extraction in the console



📘 LessonMethods — Greeting with Methods

Topic: Method declaration, input handling, and conditional logic

This project demonstrates how to structure a simple console application using custom methods:

\- Prompts the user to enter their name

\- If the input is empty, defaults to "Anonymous"

\- Generates a personalized greeting using a separate method

\- Outputs the greeting to the console

🔍 Key Concepts

\- Method declaration and return values

\- Input validation and null/empty checks

\- Conditional logic with if

\- Console interaction (Console.ReadLine, Console.WriteLine)

▶️ How to Run

\- Open the solution CSharpLessons in Visual Studio

\- Set LessonMethods as the startup project

\- Run the application (Ctrl + F5)

\- Enter your name when prompted, or leave it blank to be greeted as "Anonymous"
